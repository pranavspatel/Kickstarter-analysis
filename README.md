# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The project is about analyzing the fundraising goals of the campaigns concerning different parameters and visualising the outcomes.

### Purpose

We aim to compare the fundraising goals of different campaigns considering their launch dates and if the campaign is successful or not by analysing the funds generated to achieve their goal and visualising the results.
  

## Analysis and Challenges

We have analysed the data in two parts. The first one is based on the launch date and another one is based on the outcome of the goals.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Most of the successful fundraising campaigns are in the summer months i.e. May has the highest success of 234 campaigns followed by June and July.

Secondly, a high failure rate of 149 projects in October.

Lastly, the month of July saw the highest cancellation of 43 projects.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The highest number of successful projects are in the range of 1000 to 5000 dollars. 

Projects with a target of more than 45000 dollars are having very high failure rate. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

There was no such difficulty faced.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes-based on the Launch Date?
The month of May is the best time to start the project and in December the number of failed projects is more than the successful projects.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes-based on Goals?

Projects with a budget under the amount of 5000 dollars are having the highest success rate. As the budget increases the chance of the project failing is also increasing so it is best to keep the budget under 10000 dollars.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The projects are from different countries and have different weather and preference differs and the reason for the failure also differs.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Segregation based on the country can be done.
